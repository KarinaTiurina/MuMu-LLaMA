#  Model Setup

To evaluate the M<sup>2</sup>UGen, we first need to download the state-of-the-art models to compare against.

## SALMONN

To download the [SALMONN](https://github.com/bytedance/SALMONN) model run the following:
```commandline
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/SALMONN.git
```

Once the repo is downloaded, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/bytedance/SALMONN?tab=readme-ov-file#-how-to-inference-in-cli) to download the trained checkpoints.
